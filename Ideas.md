# Story

Antagonist Team is a (cannibal?) tribe
- hideout is a natural dungeon like a cave, forest or swamp.

eight batches, but why? for what?

free a route of specific pokemon => opens up actual encounters

have single grass patches on town maps for very special pokemon?


# Geography

three mountains
- [[Tempered Forest]] => cold, snow, ice
- [[Plains]] => thunder
- [[Tropical]] => Volcano, fire

crystal cave somewhere for [[147|Dratini]] and [[719|Diancie]]? maybe in the north?
# Bits

- Pokeballs are "magic relics"
	- different visuals? => want my green balls!
	- maybe the amount of pokemon a trainer can have could be restricted? finding pokeballs is very hard. failed catch attempts leave you with a broken ball that can be repaired.
