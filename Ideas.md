# Story

Antagonist Team is a (cannibal?) tribe
- hideout is a natural dungeon like a cave, forest or swamp.

eight batches, but why? for what?

free a route of specific pokemon => opens up actual encounters

have single grass patches on town maps for very special pokemon?

## Gym Badge Ideas

- Storm Badge (Electric)
- swamp (Water Ground)
- turtle-themed multi-type?
- on the snowy mountain (Ice)
- on the plains (Ground Normal)
