since this is only accessible with surf, it is a chance to host strong pokemon fitting the [[Tempered Forest]] climate.

- [[674|Pancham]] or [[675|Pangoro]]
- [[214|Heracross]] and [[127|Pinsir]]
- [[962|Bombirdier]]
- [[708|Phantump]]
- [[389|Torterra]] maybe

maybe [[143|Snorlax]] in a cave?


```dataviewjs
const { Pokemon } = await cJS();
dv.el("div").replaceChildren(
	Pokemon.Render.SpriteList(
		Pokemon.LinkedInCurrent(dv)
	)
);
