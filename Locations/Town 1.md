- needs to block path to [[Route 03]] until player won [[Gym 1]]
- maybe needs to block path to [[Route 02]] until player returned to [[Home Town]]

# Introduction to Team Bad
The player was sent to do something, finds Team Bad, who's blocking further advancement. Returns to [[Home Town]], then all ways are open.

# Boat to Tropicals
After finishing all [[Tempered Forest]] gyms, a dude with boat offers to ferry the player to [[Town 5]]

This dude could also be on [[Water Route 2 North]], on a short land path/beach.

maybe he was robbed by the bad team and one must go to their hideout?
